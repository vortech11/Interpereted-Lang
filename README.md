# Interpreted-Lang
This is a little interpereted context-free recursive descent parsed language writen in python.

For this project, I used the amazing book "Crafting Interpreters" as a guideline. Without it, I would be reinventing the wheel as a square, and trying to make it work.

## Features

* Full expression capabilities
    + Equations
    + Order of operations
    + Variables
* Block statements with scope
    + Combinable with all other control flow statements
* If statements
* While and for loops
    + Optional for loop components
* Variable instantiation
    + With scope!

## My goals

I plan to use this fully fledged programming language as the backbone of my Scratch Compiler project.

Once I have a way to make ASTs, I can easily create the project.json file.
